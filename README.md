# API-Job_Listing_ENG-DEU-Live
WHAT?: 
This code scrapes the web for information regarding Developer job-listing and return an API containing the job posts link and job title. This API  is accessible on RAPID-API

HOW?: 
This project uses a web scraper to get the information. 
-Node.js express
-Cheerio library

how to implement:
 currently this app only runs locally, the reason why is explained below.
 To view the content available add the route " /listings " to the end of the url in the browser: note that the Serveless function will time out due to the project being hosted on the Vercel-Free-tier which uses AWS Lambda Functions to host the code. The Application Works but you will have to download the code from guthub and run the code locally to see the results

WHY?:
To make it easier for me to apply for Jobs by having all the results i need in one place. This means i dont have to go searching through different websites because all the results i need are agrogated into one API
